I chose Backend division to apply and assigments were open to all on <a href = "https://www.innovaccer.com/hackercamp"> Hackercamp </a>.You can find the assignment on my github (<a href = "https://github.com/divyanshu1302/TweetBot"> Assignment Link </a>)

<strong> Telephonic Technical Round 1:( around 45 mins) </strong>:   Coming soon
<strong> Telephonic Technical Round 2:( around 25 mins) </strong>: Coming soon
<strong> Telephonic HR Round:( around 10 mins) </strong>: Coming soon
<strong> Advice </strong>: Mention only those things in your resume which you really know very well and be prepare with possible counter questions on them because you canâ€™t make fool of the interviewer. Be confident and take your time to understand and solve the problem and Final if itâ€™s your day no one can stop you to grab the opportunity ðŸ™‚ .
